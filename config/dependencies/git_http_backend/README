git_http_backend.py - Git "Smart HTTP" (git-http-backend) server implementation
 in Python for WSGI server architecture.
===============================================


About git-http-backend:

A special "Smart HTTP" git-specific RPC implementation allowing one to push data to remote
repo and pull data from remote repo in a very efficient way, over regular HTTP (using POSTs and GETs)

"Smart HTTP" RPC support was introduced in git client starting with v.1.6.6.

The essense of "Smart HTTP" RPC is that it's a transport for communication between client
and server's git-upload-pack and git-receive-pack - the commands ran on server when client,
respectively, "pulls" and "pushes."

"Screen-scraped" raw outputs of the commands are gzipped and are sent around as HTTP 
POSTs / replies. Some RPC-specific control strings and HTTP headers are introduced into
communication stream to signal to git client that server supports "Smart HTTP"
Client signals to the server that it supports "Smart HTTP" by talking over HTTP POST (vs. GET)

PRC supports Basic Auth over HTTP and rudimentary, server-side (not file-system-side) ACL features.

There is no published documentation on the RPC protocol. Per direct, personal inquiry with the
author of the protocol and code I confirmed that the only published "documentaion" 
is the comment-less C code in the Git repo proper.


About this project:

The project is largely a translation of similar effort done in Ruby, 
called Grack - http://github.com/schacon/grack - by Scott Chacon <schacon@gmail.com> et al.
(This readme file is modeled on the readme file in Grack)

This project aims to supplement the C-based git-http-backend CGI handler
distributed in mainline Git with a Python WSGI-compatible application.

The default git-http-backend only runs under CGI on Apache. Furthermore, Git 
packagesbinaries containing http-backend.cgi are not availableon Windows 
(as of May 18, 2010. Checked in Cygwin).

Python, WSGI-based git-http-backend implementation may run on practically any server,
on almost any OS. Look for server-specific WSGI modules or wrap WSGI app into a Fast/S/CGI.
At the most basic level, the application can be ran against Python's built-in WSGI server. 

Since there is no published documentation on Git's "Smart HTTP" RPC protocol, this
implementation is largely a guess of how it works based on my reading of original C and
Grack's Ruby code.

Dependencies
========================
* Python 2.6.x, 2.7.x (3.x is very likely NOT to work.)
* Git >= 1.6.6 (On the server and on the client side.)
